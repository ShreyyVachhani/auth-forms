# auth-forms
This repository contains fully functional registration and login forms with robust client-side validation. The project showcases the implementation of user authentication using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key features include:

- **Registration Form**: Users can register with an email and password, with real-time validation to ensure passwords match.
- **Login Form**: Users can log in with their email and password, with validation for correct credentials.
- **Interactive UI**: Forms are styled with CSS for a modern and responsive design, featuring toggle visibility for password fields and error messages.
- **Client-Side Validation**: JavaScript handles form validation, displaying custom error messages and storing user credentials in localStorage for demonstration purposes.
- **Form Toggle**: Users can switch between the registration and login forms without reloading the page.

This project is a great starting point for implementing user authentication in web applications, following best practices for user experience and validation.
